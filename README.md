# Canvas2GIF

1. Use Safari to record a canvas animation.
2. Export the results to a json file.
3. Run `python convert.py -i JSONFILE` to get the GIF.

The first version has been tested on [this set of line stamps](https://store.line.me/emojishop/product/616530bd65c6475769515686/ja). The script generates glitches in some but not all cases for unknown reasons. A successful example is `doya.gif`.
